# Simple nginx config for serving a React SPA

# Define the server
server {
    # Listen on port 80 (default HTTP port inside the container)
    listen 80;

    # Set the root directory to where our built app files are
    root /usr/share/nginx/html;

    # Default file to serve
    index index.html;

    # Serve static files directly
    location / {
        # Try to serve the requested file directly, then try as a directory,
        # otherwise fallback to index.html (for SPA routing)
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # Optional: Improve caching for static assets
